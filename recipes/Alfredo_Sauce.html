    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Olive Garden Alfredo sauce is better than the famous Italian restaurant chain's version. Alfredo sauce has
        always had my heart, whether chicken Alfredo or fettuccine Alfredo. This is a simple and basic recipe for
        Italian starters. Sprinkle some freshly chopped parsley over your plate for an added touch. Enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons sweet butter</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>

        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>

        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

        <li>1 (12 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter and olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add cream, garlic, and white pepper; bring to just under a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, until mixture is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Stir Parmesan cheese into cream mixture; simmer until sauce is thickened and smooth, 8 to 10 minutes. Add mozzarella cheese; cook and stir until melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta; cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and transfer pasta to serving plates. Spoon sauce over pasta.

        </li>
    </ol>
